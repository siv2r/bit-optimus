## Bitcoin-miner
Mining transactions in an optimal way

## Theory behind the challenge (Miner Fee)
- amount sent = amount recieved + transaction fee
- Bitcoins design makes it easier for the sender to specify the `transaction fee` than the reciever. This makes sense since, the `transaction fee` is taken from the sender's wallet.
- When a miner creates a `block proposal`, the miner is entitled to specify where all the fees paid by the transactions in that block proposal should be sent. If the proposal results in a valid block that becomes a part of the best block chain, the fee income will be sent to the specified recipient. If a valid block does not collect all available fees, the amount not collected are permanently destroyed
- To select the set of optimal transaction, miner has to solve two problems
  - **Problem1**: Transaction Fee and Size - Knapsack Problem - NP Hard
  - **Problem2**: Transaction conflicts - Maximum Independent Set Problem - NP Hard

## Problem Statement
Create a block from the pending transactions (`mempool.csv`) that has maximum possible `Miner Fee`

- ### Constraints
  - Block weight should not exceed `4,000,000`
  - Parent transaction should be included before child transaction

## Approach
- ### Intermediate Approach 1:
  - sort the mempool data by `feerate` in descenting order
  - start add transactions to the block till its `weight` is less than `4000000`
  - **Improvement:** Find a single equivalent block for a block + parents  
- ### Intermediate Approach 2:
  - If a transaction has any parent then calculate an equivalent block by combining child block with its parent (Now this equivalent block can be compared with any block present in the mempool)
  - Sort the mempool by `feerate` in descending order
  - **Improvement** Try to make sure that you create a equivalent transaction which has more number of ancestors first. For the Example: `a->b->c`, we must hit `a` before `b or c` while creating equivalent transaction
- ### Final Approach:
  - Sort the mempool by number of ancestors present for a transction in descending order
  - Follow the same steps from `Intermediate Approach 2` above
  - **Improvement** Time complexity of `findTxnIndex()`, `findEqTxnIndex()` methods in `Mempool class` can be improved using `dictionary` (looping through list in current implementation)

## Limitations
- ### Intermediate Approach:
  - Not the most optimal since some transaction requires parents to be added. Blindly adding this parent since, its child has good metric is not optimal
- ### Final Approach: 
  - Hopefully none
  - Time complexity of few functions like `findTxnIndex()`, `findEqTxnIndex()` can be improved

## Result
- ### Intermediate Approach 1: 
  - **Block fee:** `6345335 (Incorrect)`
  - **Block weight:** `4000000 (Incorrect)`
  - The above result are incorrect, the generated `block.txt` was not valid
- ### Intermediate Approach 2:
  - **Block fee:** `5714810`
  - **Block weight:** `3999804`
- ### Final Approach:
  - **Block fee:** `5797979`
  - **Block weight:** `3999808`

## My Learnings
- Revisited NP Hard, 0/1 Knapsack, Dynamic Programming
- Better understanding of DFS
- Learnt the Miner's Fee concept. Hence, got a good overview of bitcoin mining process
- Better understanding of python function and internals 
  - Reading CSV files
  - variable assignment
  - how python passes arguments (It is neither pass by value not pass by reference)
  - Debugging python using vscode

## Note
1. The `mempool.csv` has a column name `parents_`* instead of `parents`.
2. `weight`, `fee` are of type `int`.
`*` `_` above denotes space
